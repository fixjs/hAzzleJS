Roadmap
=====================

Main goal is to bring hAzzle to a version where it's stable and can be used in productions.

My plans:


- Heavy testing and fixing

- Finish the event handler system

- Minimize the code

- Add touch support

- Finish the animation engine

- Test again.

FINISH!!

I guess everything is ready to go in 1 month or so.
